The following has been implemented for the test assignment:
- Use of Kotlin. Before my experience has been mostly java trainings. I found Kotlin to be easy of use.
- Espresso. Native testing framework for Android
- Page Object Model (POM). In order to keep the code clean POM can be used to, for example, reuse functions for multiple tests.
  The Reference Android app is very minimal. Considering that in the future the app's functionality will broaden I have setup multiple page objects in the pages package.
  The tests make use of the locators and functions. Each test is further extended with the BaseTest which setups the start of a test. 

In progress:
- Firebase implementation. This was not finished due to errors with dependencies and external activities.
- Cucumber implementation. This was not finished due to time constraints.

Notes:
Last build was not able to run test. After Espresso did not recognize the android app

# Test assignment

We are looking for Automation Engineers that have the mindset "only the sky is the limit" and "automation doesn't stop at testing, it's just a beginning!" ;)

The purpose of this test assignment is to assess the applicant's automation skills, allowing him/her to show the best they can do and how fast they can learn.
It is an open assignment. There is no the right answer and there is no end goal other than proving yourself. Surprise us!

Make sure that you give detailed comments or descriptions of your tests.
When the assignment is complete, please push your solution to Github(Gitlab) and send us the link 

If you have any questions, please contact us back.

Good luck.

PS. We don't expect you to spend weeks (and sleepless nights) on doing it. Lets see how far you can get in 6-10 hours. We want to see how you approach and solve problems.

PSPS. Please use mobile native tools. (Tests written on Java are accepted too)
